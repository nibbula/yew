(defpackage :utf8b-stream
  (:documentation
   "Herein we implement the despised UTF8b stream, much to the chagrin of
everyone. Note the 'b'. The 'b' is very important! The loathsome UTF-8b stream
takes an underlying stream of regular old (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) characters,
otherwise known as octets or bytes, and converts it into UTF8b. The whole
point of this is to be able to read UTF8 characters from arbitrary bytes
WITHOUT ERRORS!!! I know that seems to be a lot to ask, but I somehow persist
in the delusion that it is possible to read things WITHOUT getting errors ALL
THE FUCKING TIME!!!!.

So, you might ask: “Not getting errors doesn't really sound as bad as you've
made it out to be, so what's the downside?” Good question. There seems to be
at least three possible downsides to this technique:

First, we have sacrificed a small range of your ‘private use’ unicode
characters. Specifically the range #xdc00 to #xdcff. In other words, this uses
them for storing any invalid UTF-8 bytes, and therefore there will be no way
to distinguish them in the resulting unicode characters, and valid private
use characters may be decoded into back into invalid UTF-8 bytes if the
reverse UTF-8b filter is used. But if this happens, what you started off with
wasn't valid UTF-8 in the first place. If you have a stream with valid UTF-8
and which uses that range of private use characters, just don't use this
filter.

The second problem is that it probably slows things down quite a bit. This
could be solved by adding UTF-8b encoding to the implementation level, where
it would have about the same performance characteristics as normal UTF8.

The third problem is that it software that uses this has to explicitly use it,
and allow for turning it off. This adds fairly pointless complexity. This
could be solved, like with the performance issue, by having in the normal set
of encodings for the implementation. Usually there is a way for the user to
pick the encoding. There are probably more problems but I forgot what they
are.")
