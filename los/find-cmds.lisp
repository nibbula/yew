(in-package :find)

;; This isn't POSIX (or any Unix) compatible. So what. The find commands on
;; various Unix systems seem to be incompatible, even though POSIX has
;; standardized it, and despite GNU and BSD adding cross-compatibiliy flags.
;; I seem to have to look up the arguments almost every time. If you want to
;; make your own compatible "find", be my guest.  Arguments to Unix find are
;; one of most complicated of any Unix command. For example it can take dates
;; in cvs(1) date format, such as "1 hour ago".  The whole thing is rather
;; insane, because file system designers keep adding new types of metadata to
;; their filesystems, which a standardized find has little chance of being able
;; to use.
;;
;; I really would prefer to use some SQL-like (or rather CLSQL) syntax for
;; finding files.
;;
;; @@@ I _would_ anyway like to add some more flags, like -time and -newer,
;; and maybe -size and -type.
