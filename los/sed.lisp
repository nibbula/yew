"Scripts are a list of (address form). Forms are Lisp code to execute when the
line matches the address. If no address matches, the line is printed. Whatever
the form returns is converted to a string, like with princ-to-string,
and used as the line. If the command returns NIL, the line is not output.

Addresses:
  Form                 Type      Description
  ──────────────────── ───────── ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  number               integer   Line ‘number’.
  :last                keyword   The last line.
  t                    symbol    Every line.
  nil                  symbol    No line. Done before reading lines.
  \"regexp\"             string    A line matching ‘regexp’.
  (first last)         cons      The range of lines from ‘first’ address to
                                 ‘last’ address. Either can be nil, to mean
                                 the start or end of the input.
  (first :plus number) cons      ‘first’ address, and ‘number’ more lines.
  (first :mod number) cons       ‘first’ address, until the line number is
                                 evenly divisible by ‘number’.

In the form, the following can be used:

Variables:
  count         The current line count.
  line          The text of the current line.
  clip          A string for copying and pasting.
  eof-p         True if we're at the last line. Same as :last address.

Functions:
  Form                           Description
  ────────────────────────────── ──────────────────────────────────────────────
  (stop)                         Stop processing the stream.
  (next-line)                    Read the next line into ‘line’.
  (append-next-line)             Append the next line to ‘line’.
  (next-file-line file)          Get the next line from ‘file’.
  (s regex replacement &key all) Substitute replacement for regex.
  (p &optional thing)            Print ‘thing’ or the current line.
  (split regex &optional thing)  Split ‘thing’ or the current line, by ‘regex’.
  (w &optional n)                After split, return the Nth thing.

;; We could also make an editing stream type.
;; See also filter-stream, which is probably more flexible, but requires more
;; code.
;;
;; We could make a posix sed out of this, but it would probably only be useful
;; for terseness. Almost every use of use sed, just uses the 's' command anyway.
;; This is actually a lot closer to awk. But to make it an awk, we would

;; split, which is what most people really use awk for.
