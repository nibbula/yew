- FILE          A file or stream to read line from. Defaults to *standard-input*.
- ADJACENT      True to consider only adjacent lines. This is like POSIX uniq.
- IGNORE-CASE   Ignore character case when comparing lines.
- ONLY-UNIQUE   Print only lines that are not repeated.
- ONLY-REPEATED Print only lines that are repeated.
- PRINT-COUNT   Print a count of duplicate when printing lines.
- SKIP-CHARS    Number of characters to skip when comparing lines.
- SKIP-FIELDS   Number of fields to skip when comparing lines. Fields are
                separated by white space.
- COLLECT       Return a list of lines. With PRINT-COUNT true, return a list of 
                conses of (count . line).
- QUIET         Don't print lines. Probably only useful with collect. Defaults
                to true when collect is true.
- WIDTH-LIMIT   Number of characters to compare when comparing lines. NIL means
                compare the whole line."
