;; Hello and welcome to yet another re-implementation of that terrible Common
;; Lisp "anti-pattern", the fd-stream, otherwise known as normal Lisp streams
;; that give you very slightly more access to the underlying operating system
;; features, most specifically the system file handle, that can be used with
;; other low level O/S API calls. On a Lisp O/S, this is probably unnecessary.
;;
;; Regardless of how wise the designers of Common Lisp were, they did not try
;; to include in the specification a portable way to work with the lowest
;; level of operating system. This was surely outside the scope of their
;; enormous task, and anyway perhaps best left to Lisp implementors. But even
;; if Lisp implementations do a perfectly wonderful job, as some do, of giving
;; us access to the operating system level of I/O, alas applications written
;; to use such facilities will not be portable between implementations. To
;; have the widest use, in the now rather sparsely populated land of Lisp, one
;; must not only be portable between hardware architecture, O/Ses, O/S
;; variations, versions and distributions, but also between implementations
;; themselves.
;;
;; In the modern world one can fairly easily get the point of needing to use
;; system level I/O features, but one would really like to provide an easy
;; to use and portable Lisp stream to higher level code. Thankfully, with the
;; MOP, and gray-streams (among others), one can make streams that will likely
;; work just like normal Lisp streams. But unfortunately such streams have to
;; re-implement most of the somewhat complex, and performance sensitive,
;; stream machinery that implementations provide with normal Lisp streams.
;;
;; So you might notice that you can find numerous examples of exactly this
;; throughout the Lisp community. I found about four to six without looking
;; too hard. So I should just be able to use one of those, and avoid the
;; horrible waste that is NIH syndrome, right? Right? Well, maybe, but it seems
;; unlikely. In any case it has to be written or adapted to the rest of the
;; opsys package and the lower level therein.
;;
;; I extend my sincere apologies to everyone for writing this.

;; This is split into three parts:
;;
;; • os-stream-base.lisp
;;   The class definitions and generic functions, other stuff which has to
;;   be used be the system specific code.
;;
;; • os-stream.lisp
;;   This is the top, OS independant layer, which mostly handles buffering
;;   and things.
;;
;; • <os>/<os>-stream.lisp
;;   The lower level in the system specific code such as unix-stream, which
;;   actually calls the system I/O functions, and where fill-buffer and
;;   flush-buffer is implemented.
