;; I know this quote from the spec lets everyone off the hook for doing a
;; half-assed job, and for good and practical reasons, but I still want to
;; minimize how much we "deviate slightly".
;;
;;  “The various file systems in existence today have widely differing
;;   capabilities, and some aspects of the file system are beyond the scope of
;;   this specification to define.  A given implementation might not be able to
;;   support all of these options in exactly the manner stated.  An
;;   implementation is required to recognize all of these option keywords and
;;   to try to do something "reasonable" in the context of the host file
;;   system.  Where necessary to accomodate the file system, an implementation
;;   deviate slightly from the semantics specified here without being
;;   disqualified for consideration as a conforming implementation.  If it is
;;   utterly impossible for an implementation to handle some option in a manner
;;   similar to what is specified here, it may simply signal an error.”
;;
;; But of course I'll probably end up doing a partially-assed job too, since
;; the whole versions in file names thing worked well in Lisp Machines and maybe
;; VMS, but seems like it would be a lot of complexity that would go unused in
;; the modern day, because everyone just uses a more complex version control
;; system where they care about it, and more efficiently, nothing, where they
;; don't. But for the case of a person using a general purpose computer, and
;; creating user managed files, it could be a great boon to have built-in
;; automatic version control. It might be an interesting experiment to try a
;; specifically versioned stream which could hook into a version control
;; system. But it's a bit weird since :supersede might mean an automatic
;; commit.

;; We're in a weird fractal frond of Greenspun/Morris land.
