(defpackage :tree-viewer
  (:documentation "View trees.

This module provides a few things.
  - A set of classes to construct and describe viewable trees.
  - An ‘inator’ user interface piece, to view the trees.

The basic unit of the trees is the class NODE, which has NODE-BRANCHES and an
NODE-OPEN indicator. A plain node can be made with MAKE-NODE. There are a
number of sub-classes of NODE which provide for different ways of describing
the tree. The class hierarchy of nodes is like:

  node
    object-node
      dynamic-ndoe
        cached-dynamic-node

The OBJECT-NODE is a simple static node which provide a NODE-OBJECT. A static
tree can be just made out of OBJECT-NODEs. You can make one with
MAKE-OBJECT-NODE.

A DYNAMIC-NDOE is node that creates it's sub-nodes by calling a function, in the
slot NODE-FUNC. There is a MAKE-DYNAMIC-NODE.

A CACHED-DYNAMIC-NDOE is a DYNAMIC-NDOE that will save the results of generating
the branches and subsequently behave like a static OBJECT-NODE.

There are methods which one can specialize to change the behavior of nodes:

   node-branches node => list of branches
     Specializing this, you can make a tree out of anything. This is how the
     dynamic and cached-dynamic trees work, so for those you would have to
     preserve their semantics, if you want them to live up to their name.

   node-has-branches node => boolean
     This is mostly provided to show the indicator on a closed node in a way
     which hints that it has branches. For dynamic trees that don't know if
     it does, this can be optimistic and return true when it's not really
     known.

There are functions for dealing with nodes and trees:

   close-all-subnodes node
   open-all-subnodes node
   node-open-p node => boolean
   all-subnodes-open-p node => boolean

   map-tree func tree &key (max-count 10000)
     Applies FUNC to each node in TREE, up to max-count nodes. You can set
     max-count to nil to try to blow out your stack.

   print-tree node &key max-depth (indent 2) key
     is mostly useful for debugging. If you don't provide a max-depth for a
     dynamic tree, you can guess the results.

There are convenience functions for making trees:

  make-tree object func &key type max-depth (test #'equal)
    Makes a tree given an object and a function that returns a list of the
    branches of the node given an object. The objects in the branches are then
    used build sub-trees as the tree is viewed. You can provide a TYPE so one
    can build a static or dynamic tree, or some combination thereof determined
    by the results of calling FUNC. You can limit the tree size by providing
    MAX-DEPTH. The TEST function can be used to detect cycles.

The module also provides methods to customize the display of the tree, in
general, or for different node types. These are the display methods.

   display-indent
   display-prefix
   display-node-line
   display-object
   display-node
   display-tree

Not all of them will be useful to a customizing given node type.
These methods may need to access the current viewer INATOR in *VIEWER*.

Once you have a tree all set up, you can call VIEW-TREE:

  view-tree (tree &key viewer default-action)

which fires up an INATOR, of which you can roll your own with the VIEWER, and
which can be customized by the usual set of INATOR-isms, keymaps, display
methods, and the like.
