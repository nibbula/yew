  #| aus der spez:
An arg, any object, is printed without escape characters (as by princ).
If arg is a string, its characters will be output verbatim.  If arg is nil
it will be printed as nil; the colon modifier (~:A) will cause an arg of
nil to be printed as (), but if arg is a composite structure, such as a
list or vector, any contained occurrences of nil will still be printed as
nil.

~mincolA inserts spaces on the right, if necessary, to make the width at
least mincol columns.  The @ modifier causes the spaces to be inserted on
the left rather than the right.

~mincol,colinc,minpad,padcharA is the full form of ~A, which allows
control of the padding.  The string is padded on the right (or on the left
if the @ modifier is used) with at least minpad copies of padchar; padding
characters are then inserted colinc characters at a time until the total
width is at least mincol.  The defaults are 0 for mincol and minpad, 1 for
colinc, and the space character for padchar.
