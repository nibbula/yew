(defpackage :config
  (:documentation "Package build configuration.

Provides a way to configure systems before loading and compiling them.
Provide for automatic default configuration.
Provide a way the user can customize the configuration.
Provide a way other programs can customize the configuration.

This is basically just an alternative to putting code in your ‘.asd’ file, in
an effort to keep ‘asd’ files declarative without side-effects.

@@@ Or maybe yet again I am not knowing about some ASDF feature that already
@@@ does this, and this whole thing is completely useless.
@@@ I guess you can use :around-compile in the ‘.asd’ to do this.
@@@ I'm not sure what's worse.

The way to use this is:

1. Make 2 files in your project:
     <system-name>-config.asd

       The system in the ‘.asd’ should depend on this package ‘:config’ and
       your <system-name>-config.lisp.

     <system-name>-config.lisp

       This should have a ‘defconfiguration’ form, or some ‘defconfig’ forms
       to define the configuration variables. Then it should have a call to
       ‘configure’ which will actually set the values.

   The easiest way to understand or do this, is to copy an already existing
   project or use a template.

2. In the ‘.asd’ for your system, use whatever ‘*features*’ or other things
   that were set up. Your code can also consult the settings in
   ‘<x>-config:*config*’.

   <x>-config:*configuration*
     is a list of configuration-variable objects that have been defined.

   <x>-config:*config*
     is a plist of values after configuration in done.

3. Load or compile, say with ‘asdf:load-system’, or ‘ql:quickload’ as normal.

4. If someone wants to do custom configuration to your package, they can
   set individual values:

     (config :<package> :option value ...)

   Or set the whole configuration:

     (config :<package> '(:option1 value1 :option2 value2 ...))

   These are equivalent to:
     (asdf:load-system :<x>-config)
     (setf (getf <x>-conifg:*config* :option) value)

     (asdf:load-system :<x>-config)
     (setf <x>-conifg:*config* '(:option1 value1 :option2 value2))

   This is also how a program can configure your package.

   OR [@@@ not done yet]

   (config :<package>)

   This will do some stupid thing where it interactively prompts you
   for configuation variables to change. Try to avoid this. In other words,
   try to make everything work right automatically, instead of having a bunch
   of confusing build options.

In general, please don't conflate this with user preferences or options, which
should be handled in an appropriate way after your software is compiled and
loaded, or with software installation, which is very different and dependant
on the operating system, package manager, etc. This is just for things to
tweak about the build process.
