  (:documentation "Parsing utilities.

This is a small set of macros for constructing simple recursive descent
parsers. It's probably most applicable to simple grammars and short inputs.
A set of macros inside a ‘with-parsing’ macro, which returns the parse
results. Results are created with ‘note’ macro.

The source is sequence of elements. In the common case of parsing a string, the
sequence is a string and the elements are characters.

Quantifiers macros are:
   (sequence-of ...)   Every form of the body must be true.
   (one-of ...)        Return after the first optional expression of the body
                       is true.
   (optional ...)      If the body doesn't evaluate to true, restore the point.
   (zero-or-more ...)  Do the body, until it returns false. Always true.
   (one-or-more ...)   Do the body once and until it is false.
   (must-be ...)       The body must evaluate true.

Result macros:
   (note (x) ...)      Push ‘x’ onto the results if the ‘body’ is true.
   (with-sub-sequence (name) ...)
                       Make name be a function that returns the current
                       sub-sequence, which the macro encloses.
   (note-part (x) ...) Combination of note and with-sub-sequence, like:
                       (with-sub-sequence (x)
                          (note ((x)) ...))

Element functions are:
   (peek)                        Return the next element.
   (next-element)                Return and consume the next element.
   (element-in E SEQ &key test)  Return true if E is in SEQ.
   (is-element E &key test)      Return true if E is the next element.
   (is-not-element E &key test)  Return true if E is not the next element.
   (in-sequence SEQ &key test)   Return true if the next element is in SEQ.
   (is-sequence SEQ &key test)   Return true if the next elementss are SEQ.

See parse-util-test for examples.
